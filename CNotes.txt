Chris Wild's notes about how to update using vagrant
====================================================

(Remote Desktop Connection)

Need VirtualBox, Vagrant and Github installed

Sign in to Github (1st time)

  (to bring in a repository)  File > Clone Repository  and Select "inzight-www" (or whatever)
  Change Current branch to "feature/update-docs"
  

   View > Repository List  (to see Repositories that have been cloned)
   OR left-click on Current Repository
   
to see webpage
--------------
   Right click on inzight-www and Select "Open in Command Prompt" (may have to click Open without Git)
   
   In Cmd window >vagrant up
   In browser go to ...  localhost:8181   
   
to edit files
--------------
   Right click on inzight-www and Select "Show in Explorer"
   Opens the Github/inzight-www folder
   
   Edit files
   
   Then Commit the changes to Github
   ---------------------------------
       go back to the repository in Github app ... ...  
       1.  Type something into the *Summary* Box before ...
       2.  Press "Commit ..." 
	   3.  Push origin (to update it on Github proper)
   
Traps to avoid
--------------
Inside the version switching code (iNZight/Lite) do not use any html mark-up (works in VirtualBox but not in the server)
