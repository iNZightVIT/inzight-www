# Development of iNZightVIT

iNZight is a student-driven project, so most of the big-scale changes occur over the (New Zealand) summer period. At other times, we mostly work on small changes and bug-fixes.

If you are interested in following iNZight, all of our work is kept on
<a href="https://github.com/iNZightVIT" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
Using the `devtools` package in __R__, you can download the latest developmental version of iNZight and try it out without waiting for a packaged release version to be made available.

To do this, just [follow the R-user installation instructions](../../ruser.php),
but use the following function call to install the development packages:
```
devtools::install_github("iNZightVIT/package")
```
where `package` is one of the iNZight packages listed on the installation page.
