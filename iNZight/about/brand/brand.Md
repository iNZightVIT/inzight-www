# Our Brand

iNZight is a fully open-source project - the code is all available to view and edit. Since our brand is important to us, you are free to use our logos and icons as-is anywhere you want (and please do!), so long as you provide a link to our website and don't make any changes!

### iNZight logo

This is our main, preferred logo for publicising iNZight.

<div class="logos">
<p>Available as a PNG</p>
<img src="/img/inzight_logo.png">

<p>and as an SVG (which might be better for websites, etc):</p>
<img src="/img/inzight_logo.svg">
</div>

(Right-click and Save-as to get the full-size graphics).

### Hex logos

These two logos (with and without a border) are used when the wide logo is too big, for example on R hex stickers!

<div class="logos">
<p>Again, we have PNGs:</p>
<img src="/img/inzight_hex.png">
<img src="/img/inzight_hex_noborder.png">

<p>and SVGs:</p>
<img src="/img/inzight_hex.svg">
<img src="/img/inzight_hex_noborder.svg">
</div>

(Right-click and Save-as to get the full-size graphics).


### Brand colours

Obviously we don't hold any sort of copyright on the colors, but here are the HEX codes if you want to use them:

<span class='swab' style='background:#18afe3'>#18afe3</span>
<span class='swab' style='background:#094b85'>#094b85</span>
