# The iNZight Team

The iNZightVIT project is led by [Professor Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/)
from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz) at the University of Auckland. He comes up with the big (and small) ideas that make iNZight intuitive and easy to learn. Since 2018, [Andrew Sporle](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/a-sporle) from McDonaldSporle Ltd has contributed ideas and funding support for extending iNZight's capabilities for use in research and official statistics.


The development of iNZight itself comes from the work of many __statistics students__ from the university, most working part-time or as part of a research project.

# Summer Students

These students worked on iNZight for their Summer Scholarship.

##### Summer 2014/15

- __Eric Lim__: modularised iNZight's Advanced Modules (Maps, Time Series, Multiple Response)
  so that they open in the same window, and did preliminary work on the Maps module.

##### Summer 2015/16

- __Jason Wen__: developed the iNZightMaps package, used in the [Maps module](../../user_guides/add_ons/?topic=maps).

##### Summer 2016/17

- __Akshay Gupta__: implemented an improved Import functionality, allowing users to read a range of different files, as well as support Meta information at the top of the file.
- __Dongning Zhang__: expanded the range of Time Series formats that iNZight recognises, allowing for weekly (2012W01) and daily (2015D01) data, as well as days-per-week (W01D01) and hours-per-day (D01H02).
- __Yu Han Soh__: started work on exporting iNZight's plots as interactive HTML/Javascript documents.

##### Summer 2017/18

- __Daniel Barnett__: developed the regional maps module, allowing users to import shape files and plot regional (e.g., country, state, etc) data onto a map

##### Summer 2018/19

- __Lushi Cai__: worked on a code-tidying algorithm which works with tidyverse-style code that collapses to fill the available width
- __Monica Merchant__: began work on predictive model building module which allows users to use multiple methods and criteria to build a predictive model
- __Yiwen He__: implemented datetime facilities to iNZight to allow users to create datetime variables and extract information (such as the year, hour) from a datetime; implemented data joining facilities

##### 2020

- __Sophie Jones__: worked on visualisation of longitudinal data under a MSc Statistics, developing a shiny app and an iNZight Addon Module linking to her new 'longZight' package.
