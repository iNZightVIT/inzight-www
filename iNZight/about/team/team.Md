# The iNZight Team

The iNZightVIT project is led by [Professor Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/)
from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz) at the University of Auckland.
He comes up with the big (and small) ideas that make iNZight intuitive and easy to learn.


The development of iNZight itself has been shared amongst many statistics students from the university,
who have worked part-time on making various parts of iNZight.
