# The iNZight Team

The iNZightVIT project is led by [Professor Chris Wild](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/)
from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz) at the University of Auckland. He comes up with the big (and small) ideas that make iNZight intuitive and easy to learn. Since 2018, [Andrew Sporle](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/a-sporle) from iNZight Analytics Ltd has contributed ideas and funding support for extending iNZight's capabilities for use in research and official statistics.

The development of iNZight itself comes from the work of many **statistics students** from the university, most working part-time or as part of a research project.
