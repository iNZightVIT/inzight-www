# Plot Toolbar Buttons

![Plot toolbar](../../img/user_guides/plot_toolbar.jpg)

The plot toolbar lies below the graphics window, and provides several useful options to users.
The buttons are described below, from left to right.




## New Plot Window

Clicking this button will open up a new graphics window that uses the default R device instead of the "container" used by iNZight. This has two particular uses:
- To permit copying and pasting of graphics (including in metafile form) by right-clicking on the graphics window,
- To permit easier resizing of the plotting window, including full screen.


## New Plot

This will create a new plot tab, allowing the currently displayed plot to be retained.
Subsequent plots will use the new tab.
You can switch between tabs by _double-clicking_ on the tab you wish to plot into.


## Refresh

Use if the plot window seems to have stopped working or is not displaying your plot properly. It re-plots the data and usually corrects the error.



## Rename

Used to rename the tab of the current plotting window.


## Save

Enables you to save the contents of the displayed plot as a file (in `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, or `.pdf` formats).


## Close

This will close the current __plot tab__, _not the iNZight window_.

For removal of some or all additions made to a plot.
