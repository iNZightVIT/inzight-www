# Plotting Two Variables

Plotting two variables is just as easy as plotting one when you use iNZight. Simply drag a second variable name into the __Variable 2__ slot, and again iNZight will automatically create the appropriate plot. Depending on the type of variables, you will get either a __bar plot__, __dot plot__ or __scatter plot__.

You can also obtain a numerical summary of the variables by clicking on the __Get Summary__ button at the bottom of the window.

## A Numeric and Categorical Variable

This combination of variables will give you a dot plot for each level of the categorical variable. This is discussed in the video below.

## Two Categorical Variables

If both Variable 1 and Variable 2 are categorical, then the resulting graph will be a two-way __bar plot__. The video below shows how to create one.

## Two Numeric Variables

If both variables are numeric, then iNZight will draw a __scatter plot__. This is demonstrated in the video below.
