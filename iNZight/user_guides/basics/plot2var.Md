# Plotting Two Variables

Plotting two variables is just as easy as plotting one when you use iNZight. Simply drag a second variable name into the __Variable 2__ slot, and again iNZight will automatically create the appropriate plot. Depending on the type of variables, you will get either a side-by-side __bar plot__, __dot plot__ or __scatter plot__. <br><br>

If both variables are categorical, then the resulting graph will be a side-by-side __bar plot__.<br>
If both variables are numeric, iNZight will draw a __scatter plot__. <br>
If one variable is numeric and the othewr is categorical, iNZight will draw a __set of dot plots__, one for each group (or category). <br>

You can also obtain numerical summaries for the variables by clicking on the __Get Summary__ button at the bottom of the window.<br><br>

This is all shown in the ___video___ below.
