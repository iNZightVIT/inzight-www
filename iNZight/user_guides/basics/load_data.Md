# Loading data

The first thing you need to do after starting iNZight is to load a data set to work with. We've made this as easy as possible, and iNZight recognizes several file types, including CSV and Excel (on Windows).

## Loading your own data

If you have a data set you would like to load into iNZight, go to the __File__ menu
and select __Import Data__. This will open the following window:

![Load data into iNZight](../../img/user_guides/basics/2_load_data.png)


In the window that pops up, click __Open__, and then use the browser to find your data, and click __OK__.
Click __OK__ again, and your data will appear in iNZight.


## Example data sets

To make it even easier to get started with iNZight, we've implemented a Example Datasets tool that allows you to quickly load several data sets that are used in the examples throughout the website.

To load an example data set, go to the __File__ menu and click __Example Data__. You'll be presented with this window:

![Load example data into iNZight](../../img/user_guides/basics/3_load_examples.png)

In the example above, we've selected the "Census at School 500" dataset from the Default iNZight module. We will be using this dataset a lot for many of our examples.


## Video Demonstration

The following ___video___ demonstrates this process to load the data set
_Census at School-500.csv_ which you can find in the __Data__ folder
that came with iNZight.
