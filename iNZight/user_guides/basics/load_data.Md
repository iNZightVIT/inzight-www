# Loading data

If you have a data set you would like to load into iNZight, go to the __File__ menu
and select __Import Data__.

In the window that pops up, click __Browse__, and then use the browser to find your
data, and click __OK__. Click __OK__ again. Your data should appear in iNZight.

The following video demonstrates this process to load the data set
_Census at School-500.csv_ which you can find in the __Data__ folder
that came with iNZight.
