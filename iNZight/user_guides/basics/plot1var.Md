## Plotting One Variable

Using iNZight, it is easy to create a graph of your variables. Simply __drag and drop__ a variable name into the "Variable 1" slot, and iNZight will automatically draw the appropriate graph depending on the type of variable:

- __Numeric variables__: these will produce a __dot plot__.

- __Categorical variables__: also referred to as __factors__, these will produce a __bar plot__.

You can also obtain a numeric summary of the variable by clicking the __Get Summary__ button at the bottom of the iNZight window. Note that you have to have dragged a variable into Variable 1 first.

The following ___video___ demonstrates how to use iNZight to plot a single variable.
