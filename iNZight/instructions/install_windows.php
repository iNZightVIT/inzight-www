<ol>

  <li>
    <b>Unzip the downloaded zipfile</b>
    <p>
      Newer versions of Windows should be able to extract iNZight without additional software.
      However, if you are running an older version of windows, you may need to use
      something like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> (it's free!) if you haven't
      already got the necessary software (such as WinZIP).
    </p>

    <p>
      When you unzip the file, in most cases it is easiest to place the folder on the Desktop.
      HOWEVER: if you are using a public computer, you may have problems running iNZight
      from the desktop due to security settings. You can either copy iNZight onto the <b>C:/</b>
      drive, or, if you cannot do this, iNZight will run from an external USB drive.

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Update iNZightVIT</b>: we are often making small updates to the software, so the packaged ZIP files
      can fall behind between major releases.
    </p>

    <p>
      To update, simply double-click on <b>UPDATE_iNZightVIT</b> and the software will take care of the rest.
      You should be presented with a message "Updating complete."; simply press <b>enter</b> on your keyboard
      to close the updater.
