  <li>
    Unzip the downloaded zipfile.
    <p>
      Newer versions of Windows should be able to extract iNZight without additional software.
      However, if you are running an older version of windows, you may need to use
      something like <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> (it's free!) if you haven't
      already got the necessary software (such as WinZIP).
    </p>

    <p>
      When you unzip the file, in most cases it is easiest to place the folder on the Desktop.
      HOWEVER: if you are using a public computer, you may have problems running iNZight
      from the desktop due to security settings. You can either copy iNZight onto the <b>C:/</b>
      drive, or, if you cannot do this, iNZight will run from an external USB drive.
