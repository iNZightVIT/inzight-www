# iNZight doesn't recognise my time variable

If your time variable is not in the format the program recognises, then you have to supply the time-structure information through the module's command window.

- Click __Provide Time Information__ and then press __CREATE__

- In __Start Date__, enter the year in which the series started

- In __Frequency__, enter the number of seasons in a year (e.g., 12 for monthly data)

- In __Season Number__, enter the number of the season at which the series started (e.g., `3` for March if using monthly data)
