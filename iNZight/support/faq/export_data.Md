# I have lost the changes I made to the data {#lost-changes}

When you ___leave_ INZight__ or __iNZight Lite__, all changes you have made to the data will be lost unless you export your data set before quitting.  
When you ___refresh the webpage___ in __INZight Lite__ the same thing happens.

The ___solution___ is to Export your data using the RData format (_as below_) before exiting/refreshing.

# Exporting data to save changes {#export-with-changes}

To save your data without losing any the changes you have made, go __File > Export__ and export using the RData format.  
When you __Import__ this exported data set (which will have a .RData filename extension) the data imported into iNZight will be just as you left it. <br><br>
For desktop iNZight, see [User Guide paragraph on exporting data](../../user_guides/file_options/#export)


# Saving a survey-design specification as well as the data {#export-with-surveydesign}

Currently this can only be done using the ___Save/Load feature___ for iNZight sessions which is still in _developmental mode_.

To enable this go __File > Preferences__ and click the checkbox for __Enable developmental features__. The ___next time___ you start iNZight the __File__ menu will give you the ability to __Save__ a session. The saved file will have the filename extension__.inzsave__. Saved sessions are read into iNZight using __Load__.
