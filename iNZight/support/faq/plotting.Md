# I'm not getting complete plots

This issue was fixed with __iNZightVIT v2.0.3__. Running the __UPDATE_iNZightVIT__ file should fix the issue.

If not:

1. Go to __File__ &gt; __Home__. This will take you back to the __iNZightVIT__ start-up window

2. Click __Start iNZight__ and iNZight will load up instantly

This works like a "Reset", but is much faster than crashing out and restarting from scratch
