<div class="note">UPDATE: this seems to have been fixed in a new release of XQuartz.</div>

This problem has mostly been encountered on Retina MacBook Pros, and is caused by the high resolution of the screen.
This appears to have been a bug in a previous version of XQuartz, and updating this seems to fix the problem.
[Download the latest version here](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.8.dmg).

If the above doesn't work, you can use the Preferences to adjust the scaling:

1. Click __FILE__ &gt; __Preferences ...__

2. Adjust the sliders to modify the values (we suggest `ps = 7` and `dpi = 220` for retina Macbook Pros)

3. Click __OK__. A new graphics windows will open up (you can close the old one if it doesn't automatically).

4. Repeat the process if you want to try out different values.

These values will be saved for future sessions. If you have trouble saving (a message will inform you) please contact
