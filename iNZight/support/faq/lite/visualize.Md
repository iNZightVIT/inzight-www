Sometimes the service we use to host Lite has caching issues. If you notice bugs, try running Lite in a private/incognito browser. If you still notice the bug, [let us know](../../contact).

### Clearing the cache might work, but can also lead to disconnection issues

If you want to try clearing the cache, search Google: "{browser name} clear cache".
For example, if you use Chrome, search "chrome clear cache".

If you don't want to do a full clear out, you can search for cache/cookie items for "lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz" and delete only those.

If you get disconnection issues afterwards, try launching a private browser.
