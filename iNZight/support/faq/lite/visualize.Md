Sometimes you need to clear the cache on your browser.

To do this, search Google: "{browser name} clear cache".
For example, if you use Chrome, search "chrome clear cache".

If you don't want to do a full clear out, you can search for cache/cookie items for "lite.docker.stat.auckland.ac.nz" and delete only those.
