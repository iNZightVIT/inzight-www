__Note__: iNZight expects spreadsheet-like data in which the first row of cells contains the _names_ of variables and everything in the column beneath a variable name is data recorded on that variable.

# Lite disconnects when I load data on a mac {#lite-disconnect-on-mac}

If you try to import a dataset that iNZight Lite cannot read, it may disconnect. A common issue among macOS users is trying to import a `.numbers` file instead of a `.csv`. iNZight cannot read `.numbers` files, so you must import the `.csv`.

Within macOS Numbers, you can save/export the file as a CSV file by
1. opening the *File* menu > *Export to* > *CSV*,
2. open *Advanced Options* and be sure to check *UTF-8* as the Text Encoding,
3. click *Next*, and choose a location to save the file,
4. finally, click *Export*.
