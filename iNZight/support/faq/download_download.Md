# I'm getting an "Untrusted Software" warning from my browser when I try to download iNZight {#untrusted}

Since we haven't paid money to Microsoft or Apple to sign the installers,
your browser may warn you not to trust them.
Depending on your browser, you should be able to override this security setting and "allow the download to proceed".

- __Chrome__: click the _down-arrow_ to the right of the download (at the bottom of the screen) and click "Proceed with the download"
