# iNZightVIT Mailing Lists

To keep up-to-date with iNZight, and follow discussions about certain features or issues, you are welcome to join one or more of our mailing lists.

We have three mailing lists, each targeting a different group/platform. You are invited to subscribe to any or all of them:

- <a href="https://list.science.auckland.ac.nz/sympa/subscribe/stat-inzight-general" target="_blank">iNZight-General</a>  
  Contains general news about iNZight and VIT, including new release announcements.
  This list is expected to be more technically focused and include discussion of more advanced features of the programs.

  To contribute to the list, subscribed users can email
  [iNZightGeneral@stat.auckland.ac.nz](mailto:iNZightGeneral@stat.auckland.ac.nz)  
  Before starting a discussion, it might pay to <a href="https://list.science.auckland.ac.nz/sympa/arc/stat-inzight-general" target="_blank">read the archives</a>


- <a href="https://list.science.auckland.ac.nz/sympa/subscribe/stat-inzight-school" target="_blank">iNZight-School</a>
