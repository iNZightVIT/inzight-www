<h3>Changes in version 2.0.1</h3>

<p>Release date: 27 March 2014
</p>


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>


<ul>
<li><p> Identify feature added to the &quot;Add To Plot&quot; menu. This
allows users to interactively label points with 'id' or any other
variable. This feature works for both dot plots and scatter plots.
</p>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p> Users can force scatter plots when the sample size is large,
rather than using the alternative grid-density plot.

levels. For categorical variables, the result is a new factor with
the same levels as the original variable, but the additional
'missing' factor level. For continuous variables, a new factor
variable with two levels, 'missing' and 'not missing' is created.
</p>
</li></ul>

<li><p> Vertical sliders added to the 'Rename Levels' and 'Rename
factor levels' windows.
