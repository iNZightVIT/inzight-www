# iNZightTools 1.13.3

- `read_text()` function replaces spaces with underscores in column names

# iNZightTools 1.13.2

- add global options to set/override default comment character (this will allow Lite to change the default without changing the package's default behaviour; default set as # at load time)

# iNZightTools 1.13.0

## New features

**Data dictionaries**

Users can now import a data dictionary and apply it to a dataset. This will apply text labels to numerically coded variables and set labels for variables with human-friendly names.

**Linked data**

New functions to load linked datasets from a `.inzlnk` file, where the file linkage is specified. Optionally users can include a data dictionary in this file, which will also be applied to the data.

# iNZightTools 1.10

- refactor `aggregateData` function to improve flexibility
- new `import_survey()` function for importing a survey design (and data) from a specification file (in TOML format)

# iNZightTools 1.9.1

- fix bug in reading delim files where, if first 1000+ rows of a column were `NA`, the column was read as logical instead of character (this is a fixed behaviour of `readr`, so cannot be overridden)

# iNZightTools 1.9.0

Minor version bump to align with release of iNZight 4.0.

- add functions for reading survey design from a file (and applying to dataset)
- add support for reading JSON files
- add new `selectVars` function
- add negative binomial as an option for `family` in `fitModel`
- add `%notin%` operator to more easily/readably check `! x %in% y`
