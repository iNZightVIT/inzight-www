# iNZight 4.4.2

## Minor changes

- move Modules to the Advanced menu

## Bug fixes

- additional bug fixes in other packages:
  - iNZightPlots
  - iNZightTS
  - iNZightTools

# iNZight 4.4.1

- fixes a bug (notable in 'Locate Points') where plots would fail due to missing variables

# iNZight 4.4.0

## Interface changes

- aggregation by date-time can now involve additional grouping variables
- uniting columns and combining categorical variables now share the same window, and added options to remove empty combinations and treat missing values as a category
- added an option to rank variables with proportional method (by percentile)
- added more methods for reordering levels of categorical variables
- added an option to specify time zone for date-time variable conversion
- added "right-join" as an option for joining data frames
- move 'paste from' to 'clipboard' menu and add 'copy to' option (to copy to clipboard) (#402)

## Structural behind-the-scenes changes

Changed all data and variable-related functions to `iNZightTools` 2.0.0.

## Modules redesigned

Mdules are now more modular, and accessed from a separate menu item 'Modules'. The modules in the 'Advanced' menu will slowly be deprecated as they are ported to the new API.

For developers, modules are now easier to maintain independently (as git submodules), and the `iNZModule` class supports installation of dependencies, plus some other methods.

# iNZight 4.3

## Interface changes

- new preference to switch between single (normal) and multiple primary variables

## Data dictionaries

- add capability to import a data dictionary (and apply to the active data, where possible)
- View Data Dictionary window to view and explore data dictionary definitions, etc

## Other changes

- enable automatic detection of delimited file separator (using `readr::read_delim`) (#401)
- Paginate dataset summary to prevent `skimr::skim()` freezing GUI when number of variables in the dataset is large
- New 'GTag' and 'GTags' classes for labels with a background and a collection of droppable labels, respectively
- add search button/clear button to search group (in data view widget)
- iNZDocument class uses global option `inzight.default.par` to override the default values for any `iNZightPlots::inzpar()` settings

## New Features

### Modules

Redesigned from the original prototype, the new modules functionality is built directly into 'iNZight', and will eventually lead to the deprecation of 'iNZightModules'. Modules can be installed at specific versions, including dependencies, and include capablity to add new menu items to 'iNZight'. Each module has its own library, which should reduce clashes where packages depend on different versions of a package.

# iNZight 4.2

## Major changes

A major change in this release is the landing screen, with a tidied interface. We have also gone through and adjusted all of the module windows to be more consistent (particularly for the button order).

- data view/switch widget updated/refactored
  - `iNZViewSwitcherWidget` -> `iNZDataToolbar`
  - "View dataset" and "View variables" buttons replaced by icons
  - add 'Dataset info' button to view data summary (using `skimr::skim()`)
  - spreadsheet view is paginated, so even large datasets can now be viewed (rows and columns)
  - variable view shows additional information, including range (for numeric) or number of levels (for factors), and number of missing values
- Control Widget:
  - enable/disable buttons and dropdowns based on what application state
  - refactor layout of Get Summary / Get Inference buttons (added to `iNZCtrlWidget`)
  - add Subset-filter button to quickly subset the dataset based on slider values
  - change icon for 'variable switch' buttons (to differentiate from pagination arrows)
- Get Summary and Get Inference
  - add CI level control to Get Inference window (#74, @tmelliott) and Plot Inference panel
  - add horizontal/vertical toggle in table summaries

## Minor changes

- create new `iNZExportWin` to replace broken `iNZSaveWin` (#374, @tmelliott)
- `iNZTransformWin` redesigned with dropdown to select boxes and buttons to apply transforms - drag-and-drop still works
- `iNZCollapseWin` uses `_` instead of `.` in new variable name
- `iNZRenameFactorLevelsWin` window modified slightly to be a little more intuitive
- `iNZConToDtWin`, `iNZExtFromDtWin`, `iNZAggregatedtWin` redesigned to have previews on the right-hand-side (rather than below)
- menu items disabled/hidden when specifying/removing survey design
- improved accuracy of estimated population size display in survey specification window
- get Summary and Get Inference now scroll output window to the top (rather than the bottom)
- change in wording of "Delete dataset" dialog to clarify what's happening
- changing values in the data view updates R Code History
- add some extra space around plot toolbar in pop-out mode
- 'Simulate P-value' checkbox removed for survey chi-square test
- Combine categorical variables allows custom separator (#389)
- add 'min' and 'max' options for date-time aggregation

## Structural behind-the-scenes changes

Many of the user-visible changes are aesthetic, and part of this change included adding a new
'superclass' for all module windows within 'iNZight'. This involved refactoring all of these
modules to inherit from `iNZWindow`. Additionally, class names where changed as listed below.

- create new `iNZWindow` 'superclass' to make it easier to create consistent pop-up windows (#375, @tmelliott). The following windows now inherit from `iNZWindow`: `iNZFilterWin`, `iNZSortWin`, `iNZAggregateWin`, `iNZStackWin`, `iNZReorderVarsWin`, `iNZReshapeWin`, `iNZSeparateWin`, `iNZUniteWin`, `iNZJoinWin`, `iNZAppendRowsWin`, `iNZDataReportWin`, `iNZValidateWin`, `iNZRenameDataWin`, `iNZConToCatWin`, `iNZTransformWin`, `iNZStandardiseWin`, `iNZFormClassIntervalsWin`, `iNZRankWin`, `iNZConToCatMultiWin`, `iNZReorderLevelsWin`, `iNZRenameFactorLevelsWin`, `iNZCombineWin`, `iNZConToDtWin`, `iNZExtFromDtWin`, `iNZAggDtWin`, `iNZCreateVarWin`, `iNZMissToCatWin`, `iNZDeleteVarWin`
  - code only displayed when user preference specified (`iNZFilterWin`)
  - renamed `iNZSortbyDataWin` to `iNZSortWin`
  - renamed `iNZstackVarWin` to `iNZStackWin`
  - renamed `iNZReshapeDataWin` to `iNZReshapeWin`
  - renamed `iNZSeparateDataWin` to `iNZSeparateWin`
  - renamed `iNZUniteDataWin` to `iNZUniteWin`
  - renamed `iNZjoinDataWin` to `iNZJoinWin`

  - renamed `iNZrenameDataWin` to `iNZRenameDataWin`
  - renamed `iNZconToCatWin` to `iNZConToCatWin`
  - renamed `iNZtrnsWin` to `iNZTransformWin`
  - renamed `iNZstdVarWin` to `iNZStandardiseWin`
  - renamed `iNZformClassIntervals` to `iNZFormClassIntervalsWin`
  - renamed `iNZrankNumWin` to `iNZRankWin`
  - renamed `iNZctocatmulWin` to `iNZConToCatMultiWin`
  - renamed `iNZreorderWin` to `iNZReorderLevelsWin`
  - renamed `iNZcllpsWin` to `iNZCollapseWin`
  - renamed `iNZrenameWin` to `iNZRenameFactorLevelsWin`
  - renamed `iNZcmbCatWin` to `iNZCombineWin`
  - renamed `iNZconTodtWin` to `iNZConToDtWin`
  - renamed `iNZExtfromdtWin` to `iNZExtFromDtWin`
  - renamed `iNZAggregatedtWin` to `iNZAggDtWin`
  - renamed `iNZrnmVarWin` to `iNZRenameVarWin`
  - renamed `iNZcrteVarWin` to `iNZCreateVarWin`
  - renamed `iNZmissCatWin` to `iNZMissToCatWin`
  - renamed `iNZdeleteVarWin` to `iNZDeleteVarWin`
- `iNZSurveyDesign` and `iNZSurveyPostStrat` specification windows using new `iNZWindow` class

Also we have added a new `update_document()` method for more modular control of the GUI document.

- `iNZexpandTblWin` uses new `update_document()` method

## Major changes

### Surveys

- NEW: better handling of survey designs using our new 'Survey design specification' format. This allows users to load pre-configured surveys from a single 'specification' file, while may optionally point at a dataset for an all-in-one import.
- survey 'data wrangling' support for almost all operations (others have been greyed out to prevent invalid actions by users); code is valid, using 'srvyr' package to provide 'dplyr'-like syntax for survey designs

### Other

- refactor of the Aggregate Data functionality, allowing users to select more than three variables and to perform aggregation over a subset of variables
- Join data now allows users to select an existing dataset, in addition to importing a new one (#340, @tmelliott)
- updated preferences window to allow new options to be added in future without getting cluttered
- create new 'Form Class Intervals' window connecting to `iNZightTools::form_class_intervals()` function; includes code and a much smoother interface, with preview of resulting intervals

## Minor changes

- when loading a new data set, existing datasets are kept (previously they were all removed; at this point I don't know why that design decision was made ...)
- allow user to delete any dataset (including the original); the previous dataset is loaded in it's place
- user preferences are are now stored in `tools::R_user_dir()`; user is prompted to create config directories
- enable code tidying (which uses the 'styler' package)
- the `disposeR` argument in `iNZight()` has been replaced with `dispose_fun`, allowing users to pass a function to be called when iNZight closes (rather then only allowing `q()`)

## Bug fixes

- fix bug when setting new data object causing code history and data's new name to be lost
- fix small bug in code writing where colon (:) remained in list of packages for installation (#352, @tmelliott)
- add close_module method so modules can close themselves and iNZight's main GUI will be restored correctly

**Plus many other fixes and changes from other iNZight packages**

---

# iNZight 4.0

This release is a complete overhaul of the way in which variables are passed around behind the scenes, making it possible to display and modify code for the current plot. The main focus for this release is to narrow the gap between GUI and coding for users interested in learning to use R.

## Major changes

- New `iNZInfoWindow` class to support both "Get Summary" and "Get Inference" which includes future scalability to code-writing and manual user-modifiable code snippets, plus an extensible command panel.
- New plot code panel displays the code for the current plot, and allows users to edit the code by hand.
- Survey designs can now be loaded from a file (.svydesign)

## Minor changes

- Add option to save interactive plots locally (including assets)
- Add support for JSON files
- Add data report (pdf/html/word) (using 'dataMaid' package)
- Add column selection and reordering dialogue (File > Select and reorder variables)
- Adds ability to quickly reload iNZight from the File menu, preserving all changes
- Added better icons to the menus

## Bug fixes

Since this is a major release, it includes many bug fixes as part of the above major changes.

# iNZight 3.0

**Release date:** 5 September, 2016

This is a major new release of iNZight, so many things have changed.
We hope you like them!

### New Features

Here's just a few of the major new features to iNZight.

- Example data sets available from the File menu
- Play time can now be stopped, and the interval adjusted
- Switch variables with the one below by clicking the "down" arrow to the right of the variable box
- **Maps Module** - visualise geographical data:
  - Coordinates: if your data set includes GPS coordinates for each observation,
    iNZight will let you plot them on a map.
  - Countries: if observations have country names associated with them,
    you can colour countries on a map by another variable.
    Try this out with the Gapminder data set included in Example Data!
- Dual Window mode - if you've used VIT, then this will be familiar to you. From File > Preferences,
  you can choose to have a separate window for graphs (as opposed to the built-in one).

### Major Changes

We can't list everything here, but some of the important ones are listed below.

- Plot toolbar has new icons
- Add to Plot window completely redesigned to make plot modification easier
- Resize points has been adjusted to resize the _area_ proportional to the value.
  Also added an "emphasize" option, which scales sizes linearly.
- **COLOUR**: new, better palettes have been introduced, including [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html),
  which are colour-blind friendly.
- Multiple Response has been overhauled to be more intuitive and fit in with the rest of iNZight.
- (temporary) Just a quick workaround for analysing tables in iNZight: Dataset > Expand Table

### Minor Changes

Given the magnitude of changes, there's little point mentioning the minor ones and bug fixes!

# iNZight 2.3

**Release date**: 4 August, 2015

## New Features

- SURVEY DESIGNS: iNZight can now handle survey designs
  (currently Strata, 2-stage (nesting) clustering, and a weighting

  window with the aim of making the interface cleaner and easier to
  navigate.
- When colouring points by a numeric variable, a continuous colour
  range is used rather than a discrete one.
- The plotting package has been rewritten to accommodate survey
  designs (this will be integrated with iNZight itself at a later
  date). However, the plots have been modified to be cleaner and far
  more efficient. Additionally, the algorithms used for the
  inference information have been updated. For more information on
  this, see the iNZightPlots change log.
- The "Get Summary" and "Get Inference" outputs have been
  redesigned to hopefully give a more intuitive, cleaner
  presentation of the information.
- From dot plots and histograms, the comparison (and confidence)
  interval values can be read from the graph by clicking 'Get Values'
  in the 'Inference Information' panel. This includes the Year 12 intervals
  applied to medians.
- LOCATOR: functionality for scatterplots vastly improved,
  allowing selection of related points, retaining points over
  multiple graphics, and selecting points by a variable.
  (similar upgrades for dot plots coming in v2.2)

### Minor Changes

- the number of missing values is now displayed on the plot,
  broken down by variable
- the list of options in the 'Add to Plot' window are now in a drop
  down menu, rather than radio buttons, to save space
- many other small UI improvements

### Bug Fixes

- if `colour by` is set, but the graph is changed to a histogram,
  the legend is removed from the plot
- fixes a bug in the plotting that was causing large values to fall off the axes
  of the plots
- includes other patches from the previous version of iNZight

## iNZight 2.0.4

**Release date**: 18 November 2014

### New Features

- The data set name is displayed above the data view
- The variable type is now displayed as a prefix to the variable
  names in the variable view
- A new "Updates Available" shows up when new versions are
  released
- A new Help tab that includes Licence information, and a link
  to the FAQ and Support pages

### Minor Changes

- In the "Remove Additions" window, "Remove segmentation" has
  been renamed to "Remove colour by" for bar plots, and
  "Restore default labels" is added to remove customised plot
  labels

### Bug Fixes

- Removes development text from Load Data window

  vastly different
- Scroll bars added to Reorder Levels window
- The menu has been moved above the plot tabs, so it no longer
  gets cut off

## iNZight 2.0.3

**Release date**: 17 September, 2014

### Major Changes

- A new Multiple Response analysis module has been added to the
  Advanced menu. This utilises the iNZightMR package developed by
  Junjie Zeng

### Minor Changes

- "Add to Plot" window modified for barcharts - can show only
  CIs, and also selects comparison and confidence intervals by default

### Bug Fixes

- Includes a suite of bug fixes in the iNZightPlots package - see its
  NEWS file for these

## iNZight 2.0.2

**Release date**: 17 June, 2014

### New Features

- can now cycle through all two-variable plots for a selected
  Variable 1
- "play" button for the first subset by variable
  (automatically cycle levels)
- data manipulation features added and modified

### Minor Changes

- can now specify to identify min/max points in a dot plot
- in the Add to Plot window for barcharts, reworded "segment by" to "colour by"
  for consistency.
- the transparency slider now runs from 0% to 100%

### Bug Fixes

- identify functionality works for subsets (except when multi plots at once)

## iNZight 2.0.1

**Release date**: 27 March, 2014

### New Features

- Identify feature added to the "Add To Plot" menu. This
  allows users to interactively label points with `id` or any other
  variable. This feature works for both dot plots and scatter plots.

### Minor Changes

- Users can force scatter plots when the sample size is large,
  rather than using the alternative grid-density plot.

- Missing observations can be converted to categorical
  levels. For categorical variables, the result is a new factor with
  the same levels as the original variable, but the additional
  `missing` factor level. For continuous variables, a new factor
  variable with two levels, `missing` and `not missing` is created.

### Bug Fixes

- Vertical sliders added to the `Rename Levels` and `Rename factor levels` windows.
- Reorder levels now works as expected, including sort by
  frequency.
- Bug where the iNZight window closes even if a user clicks
  `cancel` has been fixed.
